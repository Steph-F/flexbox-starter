            <header>Hello. I'm Stephanie.</header>
            <main>I'm a Front End Web Developer who thrives on attention to detail. When I'm not working, I can be found traveling, practicing photography, and hanging out with my 
            husband and our two pups.</main>
            <div id="div-1" class="flex-items">
                I was born in Central California, but raised in East Texas. Growing up, my family never traveled, so once I was out of the house, I started exploring the world. My first trip out of the United
                States was to Costa Rica and I instantly fell in love. My travel bug was born and now my husband and I visit new places every chance we get, both at home and abroad!
            </div>
            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                My passion: I LOVE photography - it's one of the most powerful and diverse methods for expression and communication. I am obsessed with seeing the world through others' eyes. Although I'm not very
                good at it myself, it is something I enjoy studying and practicing. 
            </div>
            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                Fun fact: My husband and I love to cook when we're home. We love trying new dishes and ingredients and practicing ways to get better. Our favorite dishes to cook are Creole and we love to add a
                taste of New Orleans to our table whenever we have the chance!
